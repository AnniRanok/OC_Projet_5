# OC_Projet_5

# Olist - a Brazilian company offering a solution for selling on online marketplaces.
Olist wishes for us to provide their e-commerce teams with customer segmentation that they can use daily for their communication campaigns.

# The goal is to understand the different types of users based on their behavior and personal data.
We need to provide the marketing team with an actionable description of our segmentation and its underlying logic for optimal use, as well as a proposal for a maintenance contract based on an analysis of the stability of the segments over time.

# The Data
For this mission, Olist provides us with an anonymized database containing information on the history of orders, purchased products, satisfaction comments, and the location of customers since January 2017.

# The mission is to help Olistâ€™s teams understand the different types of users.
We will therefore use unsupervised methods to group customers with similar profiles. These categories can be used by the Marketing team to communicate more effectively.

The proposed segmentation must be operational and easy to use by the Marketing team. It must at a minimum be able to differentiate between good and less good customers in terms of orders and satisfaction.

Secondly, once the segmentation model is chosen, we must recommend the frequency at which the segmentation should be updated to remain relevant, in order to provide a maintenance contract quote.

For your information, the provided code must adhere to the PEP8 convention to be usable by Olist.
